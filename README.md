# Description of the Repository:


This is a repository originally created by Marco Gorelli for the PYDATA 2021.
This is a case study repository which provides two examples (2 Jupyter-notebook files) that each apply an Ordinal Binomial Bayesian Model.
The examples provided here demonstrates how a researcher can evaluate the likelihood of guessing an person's educational degree by previously knowing the one's programming knowledge; the programming knowledge is here evaluated in one of the following categories: **Python**, **R**, **Neither** or **Both**.


# Updates:

Some tips and explanation comments have been provided in both jupyter-notebooks by Philipe Riskalla Leal. 

  
# Detailed Description:

In this repository, there are two jupyter-notebooks, each provides the same **example case** of how to apply a ordered logistic using MCMC.

The first Jupyter-notebook demonstrates how one can use the PYMC **Categorical function** for applying an **ordered logistic** analysis.
The second Jupyter-notebook provides another approach, the PYMC **OrderedLogistic Function**, for the same example case of the first Jupyter-notebook.

Here we highlight that both approaches ( **Categorical** and the **OrderedLogistic**) return the same results and conclusions; therefore, the selection of the model is solely dependent on the user's preference.
